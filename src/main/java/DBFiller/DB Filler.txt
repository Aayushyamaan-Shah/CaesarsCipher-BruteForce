To fill your database, please use the words.txt file provided in this package.

Steps:
1. Download the file and place it somewhere easy to access
2. Create a DB in MySQL or PostgreSQL (Here postgres was used, you might want to change that in pom.xml and JDBCHelperClasses)
3. Create a table with a single column
4. Set the parameters of the DB in the DBFiller class and the JDBCHelpers/Runners.java class
5. Once done, run the code
6. Slowly all the entries should be entered inside the database

NOTE: There a many normal words missing in the txt file, you might want to add them as required
